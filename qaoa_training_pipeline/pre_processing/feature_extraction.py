class FeatureExtractor:
    """
    An initial implementation for a graph feature extractor to be potentially
    used in a "qaoa training pipeline service".

    The features currently handled by the extractor are:

        * size (int): number of edges in the graph
        * order (int): number of nodes in the graph
        * degree (tuple(float, float)): the degree of a node is the number of edges adjacent to it.
            We interpret the degree of a graph as the average of the degree of its nodes, so this feature
            is formatted as a tuple of (avg_degree, std). If ``std==0.0``, the graph is regular.
        * weights (tuple(float, float)): average weight of all edges in the graph, formatted as a tuple (avg, std).
        * density (float): graph density defined as :math: d = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} . Where ``n`` is the number of nodes
            and ``m`` is the number of edges.
