class SATMapper(BasePreprocessor):
    r"""Permute nodes in a graph to best match a line swap strategy.

    The layout is found with a binary search over the layers :math:`l` of a line swap strategy.
    At each considered layer a subgraph isomorphism problem formulated as a SAT is solved by a
    SAT solver. Each instance is whether it is possible to embed the program graph :math:`P`
    into the effective connectivity graph :math:`C_l` that is achieved by applying :math:`l`
    layers of the swap strategy to the coupling map :math:`C_0` of the backend. Since solving
    SAT problems can be hard, a ``time_out`` fixes the maximum time allotted to the SAT solver
    for each instance. If this time is exceeded the considered problem is deemed unsatisfiable
    and the binary search proceeds to the next number of swap layers :math:``l``.

    Warning: for large instances the SATMapper can take a lot of pre-processing time.

    The SAT mapper is based on this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05666.
